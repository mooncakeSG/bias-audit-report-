# Bias Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive bias audit conducted on our machine learning model. The audit examined fairness across multiple protected attributes including gender, race, and education level. The analysis reveals significant disparities in model performance and predictions across different demographic groups, indicating the presence of algorithmic bias that requires immediate attention.

## Key Findings

- **Gender Bias**: Male applicants receive favorable predictions 24.2% more often than female applicants
- **Racial Bias**: White applicants show 25% higher positive prediction rates compared to Black applicants
- **Education Bias**: PhD holders receive favorable outcomes 30.5% more often than high school graduates
- **Overall Bias Severity**: High to Severe across all protected attributes

## Methodology

### Audit Framework

Our bias audit employed a multi-dimensional fairness assessment framework evaluating:

1. **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
2. **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates across groups
3. **Accuracy Parity**: Consistent model accuracy across demographic groups
4. **Calibration**: Equal probability of positive outcomes given positive predictions

### Data Analysis

- **Dataset Size**: 1,000 samples
- **Protected Attributes**: Gender, Race, Education Level
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, TPR, FPR
- **Fairness Metrics**: Demographic parity difference, Equalized odds difference

|--------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Accuracy | 67.5% | 75.0% | 81.5% | 84.0% |
| Positive Prediction Rate | 42.5% | 56.7% | 68.5% | 73.0% |
| True Positive Rate | 60.1% | 73.4% | 85.6% | 88.9% |

**Assessment**: High bias detected. Clear correlation between education level and favorable outcomes.

## Bias Severity Assessment

### Overall Bias Classification

- **Gender**: High Bias (Demographic Parity Difference: 0.242)
- **Race**: Severe Bias (Demographic Parity Difference: 0.250)
- **Education**: High Bias (Demographic Parity Difference: 0.305)

### Impact Analysis

The identified biases have significant implications:

1. **Legal Compliance Risk**: Potential violations of equal opportunity regulations
2. **Ethical Concerns**: Systematic disadvantage of protected groups
3. **Business Impact**: Reduced diversity and potential talent loss
4. **Reputational Risk**: Public perception and stakeholder trust issues

## Root Cause Analysis
